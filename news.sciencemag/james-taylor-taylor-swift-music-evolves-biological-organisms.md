In the early 1990s, rap took over the radio: Songs by Snoop Dogg and Jay Z played everywhere. Was this a musical revolution or merely the result of a gradual change in tastes over time? Researchers say they’re now able to answer such questions, thanks to the largest data-driven study of pop music ever undertaken. Applying evolutionary theory to this data set, they say, could settle several debates that have raged over pop music for decades.

在90年代早期，说唱音乐占据着整个广播：到处都在播放snoopy Dogg和Jay Z的歌。这到底是音乐的革命还是仅仅是人们对音乐的品味随时间变化的结果？由于最大的基于数据驱动流行音乐研究正在开展，研究着现在可以回答这些问题了。将进化理论应用到这些数据，他们说，可以解决一些横行流行音乐十几年的论题。

Among art forms, music seems particularly well suited to data-driven analysis. After all, the features that distinguish one piece of music from another—rhythm, harmony, melody—are intrinsically mathematical. Researchers have long wanted to study the evolution of music with the same rigorous tools that biologists use to study the evolution of species. But tangled copyright protections make it difficult to access musical data sets on a large scale, because even data mining of musical recordings may not be allowed without permission. And determining a representative sample of musical culture for a particular place and time is challenging. For example, even though we have millions of musical scores from the Baroque era, we have no idea how often any of them were actually performed.

在各种艺术形式中，音乐似乎特别适合数据驱动的研究。毕竟，区别音乐种类的特征-----旋律、和声和节奏，本质上都可以被数学化。研究者一直都想用生物学研究物种进化严格的工具的来研究音乐的进化。但是纠结的版权保护是的很难大规模的获取音乐数据集，因为即使对音乐录音的数据挖掘在没有许可的时候都很难被允许。同时决定一个代表性样本比如在音乐史中到底处于哪个特定的地位和时间是很有挑战性的。比如，我们有上百万来自巴洛克时代的音乐评分，我们却不知道它们中任何一个到底被演奏了多少次。

To solve the sampling problem, a team led by Matthias Mauch, a computer scientist at the Queen Mary University of London, turned to the U.S. Billboard Hot 100, the American music industry's weekly list of popular singles. The researchers scraped data from the Billboard website, collecting the titles and artists for some 17,000 songs that made the list between 1960 and 2010.

为了解决抽样问题，由Queen Mary University of London 计算机科学家Matthias Mauch领导的团队，求助于美国的billboard Hot 100，一个美国的音乐届每周最火音乐清单。研究者从Billboard网站上抓取数据，收集从1960年到2010年的大约17000首歌的歌名和演唱者。

Getting the actual song recordings was the trickier problem. Luckily, Mauch used to work at the British online music recommendation service Last.fm, and he knew the company had a vast database of 30-second music samples that it used to preview its wares. Those samples turned out to be large enough to power a massive comparative analysis.

获取真实的歌曲是更难的问题。幸运的是，Mauch曾经在英国在线音乐推荐机构Last.fm工作，他知道这家公司有大量歌曲用于预览的30秒钟样本的数据库。这些样本对于提供庞大的分析比较是足够大的。

Rather than relying on human judgment to compare songs, the team used a statistical technique that extracts features of the recordings like timbre and harmony before grouping them into clusters. To make sure the clusters were meaningful, the researchers compared them with groups of songs created by Last.fm’s millions of users. For example, users put songs by Snoop Dogg, Ludacris, and Jay Z together in the “rap and hip hop” category. But using just the timbre and harmony features, the computer clustered them into nearly identical groups. Encouraged by the similarity, the team then analyzed these massive data with an evolutionary analysis, treating the statistical traits shared among songs like biological traits.

语气依赖人工判断来比较歌，团队使用了一种统计技术，在分组成集群之前提取出歌曲的特征如音色和和旋。为了确保每个集群有意义，研究者将这些组合Last.fm上百万用户分的组进行比较。比如，用户将Snoop Dogg, Ludacris和Jay Z的歌都放在“说唱和嘻哈”这个目录下。但是仅仅只用音色和和旋作为特征，电脑将他们聚类成差不多相似的组群。受相似性的启发，团队接下来用一种进化方法来分析这些大数据，像对待生物特征一样对待这些歌之间的统计特征。

Far from becoming formulaic and homogeneous, as some critics have argued, pop music is as diverse now as it has ever been, the researchers found. And it didn’t evolve gradually. Instead, the analysis revealed several dramatic revolutions. The first was in 1964 during the rise of rock and soul music, when bands such as the Beatles drew huge crowds. The next started in 1983 with disco, new wave, and hard rock. And the most recent, and by far the most transformative, started in 1991 with the explosion in rap and hip hop. As Mauch and his team conclude today in Royal Society Open Science, rap is "the single most important event that has shaped the musical structure of the American charts over the past 50 years." Its powerful influence on the structure of pop music continues today; the occasional rap interlude now finds its way into many a rock song, for example.

远离公式化和同构，正如有些批评家认为的，研究者发现流行音乐现在处在最多样化的时候。并且它不是逐渐进化的。研究反而揭露了几个戏剧性的变革。第一次是在1964年，正直摇滚和灵乐的兴起，当类似于甲壳虫的乐队吸引着广大的群众。第二次开始于1983年迪斯科，新浪潮和硬摇滚的出现。最近也是最具变化性的是1991年说唱和嘻哈的大爆发。正如Mauch和他的团队在《皇家社会公开科学》总结的，说唱是“过去50年最重要的构成美国音乐榜单的音乐结构”。它在流行音乐结构上强有力的影响持续至今，比如很多摇滚音乐中都时不时穿插一段说唱。

"This is rigorous," says Jean-Baptiste Michel, a data scientist at Harvard University and Palantir Technologies, which is headquartered in Palo Alto, California, who was lead author of a 2010 Science paper that kicked off the study of culture through massive data sets. "More researchers need to take this approach." One of the findings that stands out, he says, is that pop music shows a pattern from biological evolution known as punctuated equilibrium, in which periods of gradual change are separated by explosions of complexity. The most famous example in geological history is the Cambrian explosion, a sudden, massive increase in biodiversity in the fossil record 542 million years ago. "There are differences, of course," he says, "since biological evolution has the direct parent-offspring relationship, and we don't know the mechanisms even in biology. So we have to be careful."

“这太严谨了” Jean-Baptiste Michel说，一个哈佛大学数据研究者和Palantir的技术师，总部在Palo Alto, California，他是2010年一篇science的文章的主要作者，这篇文章是利用大规模数据进行文化分析的开山之作。“更多的研究者需要使用这个方法”，引人注目的发现之一，他说，是流行音乐展示出一种生物进化的模式叫间断平衡，渐变的时期被爆炸性变化时期间隔。最著名的例子是地质历史中的寒武纪大爆发时期，5.42亿年前的化石记录中，生物多样性发生突然巨大的增加。“区别当然还是存在的”他说，“因为生物进化有直接的“父子关系”，而且我们还不知道它的生物机制，所以我们需要格外小心“。
